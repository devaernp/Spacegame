Space Game is a four player hot seat space shooter game.

To run this game you must have python and pygame installed on your computer.

Instructions:

The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the other three players in the game.
Each player has 5 controls, up, down, left, right, and fire. You always fire forward in the direction you are facing (which is determined by the last direction you moved). Try moving on diagonals for some cool driveby manouvers! The HUD on the left side of the screen shows each players remaining shield (blue) and hull(red). 

This game has two distinct was to play. All players on the same keyboard or using multiple keyboards to play. I encourage you to try both.
